# Assessing the Effectiveness of Nonlinear Shrinkage Estimator in the Context of Multi-dimensional Data on the Vietnamese Stock Market
In the context of rapidly expanding data and significant market fluctuations, traditional investment strategies are increasingly proving to be ineffective. In this study, the author focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of the Non-linear shrinkage method for covariance matrix estimation, a modern technique in optimal portfolio selection. The research findings demonstrate that the Non-linear shrinkage method significantly outperforms traditional linear shrinkage methods (STIM, SSIM) and the general market index (VN-INDEX) in aspects such as profitability (Average Annual Return), risk (Average Annual Volatility), and the Sharpe ratio during backtesting period from 2020 to 2023. Notably, the winning rate of the Non-linear shrinkage method is also higher than that of other methods, further enhancing its appeal as a superior investment choice. These results affirm the outstanding potential of the Non-linear shrinkage estimation method in optimizing investment portfolios.
